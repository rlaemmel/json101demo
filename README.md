A demonstration of analyzing the JSON dump of the 101wiki

# Description

Simple tag clouds are computed for the frequency of languages and technologies across the implementations in 101repo. The languages and technologies, as declared on the wiki, are counted here. (We could also use the 101meta-based rule-based system to determine ) Indeed, the JSON-based dump of the 101wiki readily lists those languages and technologies.

# Input 

The [101wiki dump](http://data.101companies.org/dumps/Wiki101Full.json) as available as 101data.

# Output

* Language frequency over all implementations: [[.json]](languages.json); [[.html]](languages.html)
* Technology frequency over all implementations: [[.json]](technologies.json); [[.html]](technologies.html)
