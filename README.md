# Headline

A demonstration of analyzing the JSON dump of the 101wiki

# Motivation

Simple tag clouds are computed for the frequency of languages and technologies across the 101implementations in 101repo. The languages and technologies, as declared on the wiki, are counted here. Indeed, the JSON dump of the 101wiki readily lists languages and technologies for each 101implementation. (In another experiment, we could also use 101meta-based rules to determine frequency.)

# Features

TBD

# Input 

The [101wiki dump](http://data.101companies.org/dumps/Wiki101Full.json) as available as 101data.

# Output

* Language frequency over all implementations
* Technology frequency over all implementations 

Frequency is represented both in .json and .html files.
